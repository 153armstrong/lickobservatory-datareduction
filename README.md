Data Reduction - Lick Observatory

Adapted from the code written by Elinor Gates at the Lick Observatory, the following version performs Overscan Subtraction, Bias Subtraction, flat field correction and bad pixel correction on the given data files.

Before you begin this data reduction you first have to look at the logsheet and classify the images into bias, dome flats,twilight flats and the rest of the data files and place them in separate folders like so:
